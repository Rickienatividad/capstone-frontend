# Ruby on Reels - Front-end

This is the front component for a fishing utility app that gives users access to reference material such as images and habits of freshwater species of fish, knot tying instructions and examples, and a map depicting locations of public boat ramps in the state of South Carolina. The front-end was built in React.js. The back-end was built in Ruby on Rails. Future features will allow the user to drop a marker on the map that associates with the location of their log entries.
